# kalman-matrix-utils
NOTE: I am not the author of these files.
This was taken from https://github.com/sunsided/kalman-clib/tree/master with only the relevant matrix files and unit tests. 

The matrix implementations here offer a well unit-tested way of doing the operations required for kalman filters without dynamic memory allocation, making it attractive for embedded systems.
